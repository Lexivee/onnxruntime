# Android Test Application for ORT-Mobile 

This directory contains a simple android application for testing [ONNX Runtime AAR package](https://www.onnxruntime.ai/docs/how-to/build.html#build-android-archive-aar).

## Background

For general usage and build purpose of ORT-Mobile Android, please see the [documentation](https://www.onnxruntime.ai/docs/how-to/build.html#android) here.

### Test Android Application Overview

This android application is mainly aimed for testing:

- Model used: A simple [sigmoid ONNX model](https://github.com/onnx/onnx-docker/blob/master/onnx-ecosystem/inference_demos/simple_onnxruntime_inference.ipynb) (converted to ORT format under `app\src\androidTest\assets` folder)
- Main test file: An android instrumentation test under `app\src\androidtest\java\ai.onnxruntime.example.javavalidater\SimpleTest.java`
- The main dependency of this application is `onnxruntime` aar package under `app\libs`.
- The MainActivity of this application is set to be empty.

### Requirements

- JDK version 8 or later is required.
- The [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) build system is required for building the APKs used to run [android instrumentation tests](https://source.android.com/compatibility/tests/development/instrumentation). Version 6 or newer is required.

### Building

Use the android's [build instructions](https://www.onnxruntime.ai/docs/how-to/build.html#android-build-instructions) with `--build_java` and `--android_run_emulator` option.

Please note that you may need to set the `--android_abi=x86_64` (the default option is `arm64-v8a`). This is because android instrumentation test is run on an android emulator which requires an abi of `x86_64`.

#### Build Output

The build will generate two apks which is required to run the test application in `$YOUR_BUILD_DIR/java/androidtest/android/app/build/outputs/apk`:

* `androidtest/debug/app-debug-andrdoidtest.apk` 
* `debug/app-debug.apk`

After running the build script, the two apks will be installed on `ort_android` emulator and it will automatically run the test application in an adb shell.

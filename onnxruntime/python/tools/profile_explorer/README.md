# Profile Explorer

Profile Explorer is a script that makes analyzing profile outputs generated by ONNX Runtime a breeze. Simply point the script at a generated .json file and gain visibility into the aspects of the model that are taking the most time.

## Usage

For the most up-to-date options, please run `python ./profile_explorer.py --help` to see a list of all options. Here are some of the common use cases covered:

Find the top-5 operators that are taking the most amount of time:
```bash
python ./profile_explorer.py --count 5 <JSON file containing profiling data>
```

Perform a shape sensitive version of the previous command:
```bash
python ./profile_explorer.py --count 5 --shape-sensitive <JSON file containing profiling data>
```

Be sensitive to GPU kernel dimensions while performing the top-5 analysis, in addition to kernel input shapes:
```bash
python ./profile_explorer.py --count 5 --shape-sensitive --dimension-sensitive <JSON file containing profiling data>
```

Use a custom C++ name demangler to produce readable outputs for GPU kernel names:
```bash
python ./profile_explorer.py --count 5 --demangler </path/to/your/favorite/demangler> <JSON file containing profiling data>
```

Save output to CSV files with names prefixes `profile_output`
```bash
python ./profile_explorer.py --count 5 --csv profile_output <JSON file containing profiling data>
```

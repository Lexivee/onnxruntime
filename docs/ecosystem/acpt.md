## Why should I use ACPT?
* **Flexibility:** Use as-is with preinstalled packages or build on top of the curated environment.
* **Ease of use:** All components are installed and validated against dozens of Microsoft workloads to reduce setup costs and accelerate time to value.
* **Efficiency:** Avoid unnecessary image builds and only haveâ€¯required dependencies that are accessible right in the image/container.
* **Optimized training framework:** Set up, develop, and accelerate PyTorch models on large workloads, and improve training and deployment success rate.
* **Up-to-date stack:** Access the latest compatible versions of Ubuntu, Python, PyTorch, CUDA/RocM, etc.
* **Latest training optimization technologies:** Make use of ONNX Runtime, DeepSpeed, MSCCL, and more.

## Support
Version updates for supported environments, including the base images they reference, are released every two weeks to address vulnerabilities no older than 30 days. Based on usage, some environments may be deprecated (hidden from the product but usable) to support more common machine learning scenarios.

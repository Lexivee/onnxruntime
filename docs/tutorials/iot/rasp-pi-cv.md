## Prerequisites
- [Raspberry Pi 3 B board](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/)
- SD Card Imaged with [Debian from the Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
- Raspberry Pi [Camera Module](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/camera-module-v2/) or other compatible camera.
- [VNC Viewer](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/remote-access.html#vnc) for remote access. Optionally you can connect the board to a monitor.
- This tutorial will _not_ cover imaging and setting up the Raspberry Pi. Basic understanding of how to configure and program with python on the Raspberry Pi is expected.

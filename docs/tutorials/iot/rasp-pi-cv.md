# ONNX Runtime IoT Deployment on Raspberry Pi
{: .no_toc }

In this tutorial we will look at how we can deploy ML Models to a Raspberry Pi edge device. There are many benefits and use cases for deploying models to edge devices. Check out the list on our [IoT tutorial home page](index.md). It is assumed that you have a basic understand of how to image and configure a Raspberry Pi. If you have not done with before check out the [Raspberry Pi documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html) to get your device setup.

## Prerequisites
- [Raspberry Pi 3 B board](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/)
- SD Card Imaged with [Debian from the Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
- Raspberry Pi [Camera Module](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/camera-module-v2/) or other compatible camera.
- [VNC Viewer](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/remote-access.html#vnc) for remote access. Optionally you can connect the board to a monitor.
- This tutorial will _not_ cover imaging and setting up the Raspberry Pi. Basic understanding of how to configure and program with Python on the Raspberry Pi is expected.

## Download the Source and install the packages

Once you have imaged the Raspberry Pi

Its time to download the source to the Raspberry Pi

## Test the Camera
No

## Install the prerequisites

## Run Inference

## Part 2 Add a Remote Control Arduino Powered Car

Now that you have got the CV model working on the Raspberry Pi, lets look at how we can add it to a remote control car. The instructions to build the remote control car can be found on this (Instructables tutorial)[https://www.instructables.com/HackerBoxes-0013-Autosport/]

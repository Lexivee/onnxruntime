This is a python sample application for demoing industrial/clean room use case using ONNXRuntime OpenVINO Execution Provider.

1. The Object detection sample uses a pre-trained Tiny YOLOv2 Deep Learning ONNX Model from Intel. 
 
2. The Clean Room Worker Safety sample demonstrates object detection in an industrial/clean room use case. The sample involves presenting a frame-by-frame video to the ONNX Runtime (RT), which uses the OpenVINO Execution Provider to run inference on various Intel hardware, such as CPU, iGPU, accelerator cards like NCS2 and VAD-M. This sample uses a pretrained Tiny YOLOv2 Deep Learning ONNX Model for the detection of safety gear (e.g., bunny suit, safety glasses), robots, and heads, and can be used for hazard detection purposes.

# Working
The Worker Safety Demo is a python script that runs deep learning inference on a public video of an Intel Cleanroom with a Tiny-YoloV2 model (public topology, weights generated from training on the public video). The script loads the model into the open source OnnxRuntime framework, performs post-processing on the results of the inference, and generates a new video containing the bounding boxes and labels for objects superimposed on each frame.

The source code for this sample is available [here](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/tree/master/samples/python/OpenVINO_EP_samples/cleanroom_worker_safety).

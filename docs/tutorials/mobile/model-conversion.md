## Converting ONNX models to ORT format 

Conversion of ONNX format models to ORT format utilizes the ONNX Runtime python package, as the model is loaded into ONNX Runtime and optimized as part of the conversion process. 

For ONNX Runtime version 1.8 and later the conversion script is run directly from the ONNX Runtime python package.<br>
For earlier versions, the conversion script is run from the local ONNX Runtime repository created during the [initial setup](initial-setup#clone-onnx-runtime-repository).

### Basic processing

The conversion script performs two functions:
  1. Loads and optimizes ONNX format models, and saves in ORT format
  2. Determines the operators, and optionally data types, required by the optimized models, and saves these in a configuration file for use in the custom build.


The conversion script can run on a single ONNX model, or a directory. If run against a directory, the directory will be recursively searched for '.onnx' files to convert. 

Each '.onnx' file will be loaded, optimized, and saved in ORT format as a file with the '.ort' extension in the same location as the original '.onnx' file.

A build configuration file ('required_operators.config') will be produced with the operators required by the optimized ONNX models.

If [type reduction](#enable-type-reduction) is enabled (ONNX Runtime version 1.7 or later) the configuration file will also include the required types for each operator, and be called 'required_operators_and_types.config'.

If you are using a pre-built ONNX Runtime Mobile package the build configuration file is not used and can be ignored. 

### Script usage

ONNX Runtime version 1.8 or later:
  - `python -m onnxruntime.tools.convert_onnx_models_to_ort <path to .onnx file or directory containing one or more .onnx models>`

ONNX Runtime version 1.5 to 1.7:
  - `python <ONNX Runtime repository root>/tools/python/convert_onnx_models_to_ort.py <path to .onnx file or directory containing one or more .onnx models>`

The current optional arguments are available by running the script with the `--help` argument.
Supported arguments and defaults differ slightly across ONNX Runtime versions.

```
python -m onnxruntime.tools.convert_onnx_models_to_ort --help
usage: convert_onnx_models_to_ort.py [-h] [--use_nnapi] [--optimization_level {disable,basic,extended,all}] [--enable_type_reduction]
                                     [--custom_op_library CUSTOM_OP_LIBRARY] [--save_optimized_onnx_model]
                                     model_path_or_dir

Convert the ONNX format model/s in the provided directory to ORT format models. 
All files with a `.onnx` extension will be processed. For each one, an ORT format model will be created in the same directory. 
A configuration file will also be created called `required_operators.config`, and will contain the list of required operators for all converted models. 
This configuration file should be used as input to the minimal build via the `--include_ops_by_config` parameter.

positional arguments:
  model_path_or_dir     Provide path to ONNX model or directory containing ONNX model/s to convert. All files with a .onnx extension, including in subdirectories, will be processed.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --optimization_level {disable,basic,extended,all}
                        Level to optimize ONNX model with, prior to converting to ORT format model. 
                        These map to the onnxruntime.GraphOptimizationLevel values. 
                        If the level is 'all' the NCHWc transformer is manually disabled as it contains device specific logic, 
                        so the ORT format model must be generated on the device it will run on. 
                        Additionally, the NCHWc optimizations are not applicable to ARM devices.
  --enable_type_reduction
                        Add operator specific type information to the configuration file to potentially 
                        reduce the types supported by individual operator implementations.
  --custom_op_library CUSTOM_OP_LIBRARY
                        Provide path to shared library containing custom operator kernels to register.
  --save_optimized_onnx_model
                        Save the optimized version of each ONNX model. This will have the same optimizations 
                        applied as the ORT format model.
```

### Optional conversion script arguments

##### Optimization level

Set the optimization level that ONNX Runtime will use to optimize the model prior to saving in ORT format.

For ONNX Runtime version 1.8 and later, *all* is recommended if the model will be run with the CPU Execution Provider (EP).
For earlier versions, *extended* is recommended, as the *all* level previously included device specific optimizations that would limit the portability of the model.

If the model will potentially be run with the NNAPI EP or CoreML EP, it is recommended to create an ORT format model using the *basic* optimization level. Performance testing should be done to compare running this model with the NNAPI or CoreML EP enabled vs. running the model optimized to a higher level using the CPU EP to determine the optimal setup. 

See the documentation on [performance tuning mobile scenarios](../references/mobile-performance-tuning) for in-depth information.

##### Enable type reduction

With ONNX Runtime version 1.7 and later it is possible to limit the data types the required operators support to further reduce the build size. This pruning is referred to as "operator type reduction" in this documentation. As the ONNX model/s are converted, the input and output data types required by each operator are accumulated and included in the configuration file. 

If you wish to enable operator type reduction, the [Flatbuffers](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/) python package must be installed.
  - `pip install flatbuffers`

For example, the ONNX Runtime kernel for Softmax supports both float and double. If your model/s use Softmax but only with float data, we can exclude the implementation that supports double to reduce the kernel's binary size. 

##### Custom Operator support

If your ONNX model uses [custom operators](../add-custom-op), the path to the library containing the custom operator kernels must be provided so that the ONNX model can be successfully loaded. The custom operators will be preserved in the ORT format model.

##### Save optimized ONNX model

Add this flag if you wish for the optimized ONNX model to also be saved. This model will contain the same nodes and initializers as the ORT format model, and can be easily viewed in [Netron](https://netron.app/).

M\+L\+AS is a compute library containing processor optimized G\+E\+MM kernels and platform specific threading code.

\section*{Unit tests for M\+L\+AS}

Unit tests for the S\+G\+E\+MM kernels are available under onnxruntime. These tests run over a range of inputs that then execute the various special cases for aligned and unaligned outputs. The tests have failed if any \char`\"{}mismatch\char`\"{} strings are printed.

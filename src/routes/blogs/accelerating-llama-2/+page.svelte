		<p class="mb-4">
			Interested in running Llama2 faster? Let us explore how ONNX Runtime can propel your Llama2
			variants for faster inference!
		</p>

		<p class="mb-4">
			You can now experience significant inference gains—up to 4X faster—for the 7B, 13B, and 70B
			models, thanks to state-of-the-art fusion and kernel optimizations with ONNX Runtime. This
			blog details performance enhancements, dives into ONNX Runtime fusion optimizations, multi-GPU
			inferencing support, and guides you on how to leverage the cross-platform prowess of ONNX
			Runtime for seamless inferencing across platforms. This is the first in a series of upcoming
			blogs that will cover additional aspects for efficient memory usage with ONNX Runtime
			quantization updates, and cross-platform usage scenarios.
		</p>

		<h2 class="text-blue-500 text-3xl mb-4">Background: Llama2 and Microsoft</h2>

		<p class="mb-4">
			Llama2 is a state-of-the-art open source LLM from Meta ranging in scale from 7B to 70B
			parameters (7B, 13B, 70B). Microsoft and Meta announced their AI on Azure and Windows
			collaboration in July 2023. As part of the announcement, Llama2 was added to the Azure AI
			model catalog, which serves as a hub of foundation models that empower developers and machine
			learning (ML) professionals to easily discover, evaluate, customize, and deploy pre-built
			large AI models at scale.
		</p>

		<p class="mb-4">
			ONNX Runtime allows users to easily integrate the power of this generative AI model into your
			apps and services with improved optimizations that yield faster inferencing speeds and lower
			your costs.
		</p>

		<h2 class="text-blue-500 text-3xl mb-4">
			Faster Inferencing with new ONNX Runtime Optimizations
		</h2>

		<p class="mb-4">
			As part of the new 1.16.2 release, ONNX Runtime now has several built-in optimizations for
			Llama2, including graph fusions and kernel optimizations. The inference speedups, when
			compared to Hugging Face (HF) variants of Llama2 in PyTorch compile mode for prompt latency of
			CUDA FP16, are mentioned below. We see ~3X gains in end-to-end throughput comparisons for both
			7B, and 13B models. The end-to-end throughput or wall-clock throughput shown below is defined
			as batch size * (prompt length + token generation length) / wall-clock latency) where
			wall-clock latency = the latency from running end-to-end and token generation length = 256
			generated tokens. The E2E throughput is up to 4.5X faster when compared to PyTorch Compile.

		<p class="mb-4">
			The graphs below show latency comparisons between the ORT and PyTorch variants of the Llama2
			7B model on CUDA FP16. Latency here is defined as the time it takes to complete one pass
			through the model to produce the logits and synchronize the outputs.

		<h2 class="text-yellow-500 mb-4">Figure 2: Prompt Latency Comparisons</h2>

		<p class="mb-4">
			Token generation throughput below is the average throughput of the first 128 tokens generated.
			We see up to 3.5X gains in token generation throughput when compared to PyTorch Eager and
			Compile modes. The token generated throughput measured in Tokens per Second (TPS) is 3.5X
			faster with ONNX Runtime as compared to PyTorch versions of the model.

		<h2 class="text-blue-500 text-3xl mb-4">ONNX Runtime with Multi-GPU Inference</h2>

		<p class="mb-4">
			ONNX Runtime supports multi-GPU inference to enable serving large models. The LLaMA-2 70B
			model has 70 billion parameters, and even in FP16 precision, the model requires 140GB. Loading
			the model requires multiple GPUs for inference, even with a powerful NVIDIA A100 80GB GPU.
		</p>

		<p class="mb-4">
			ONNX Runtime applied Megatron-LM Tensor Parallelism on meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-hf to split the
			original model weight onto different GPUs. Megatron shard on meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-hf model
			shards the PyTorch model with FP16 into 4 partitions, converts each partition into ONNX
			format, and then applies a new ONNX Runtime graph fusion on the converted ONNX model. The 70B
			model has ~30 tokens per second throughput for token generation at batch size 1, and
			end-to-end throughput starts at 30 ms for smaller sequence lengths with these optimizations.
			You can find additional example scripts here.

		<p class="mb-4">
			The techniques that ONNX Runtime uses for optimizations, such as graph fusions, are applicable
			to state-of-the-art models. As these models become more complex, the techniques used to apply
			the graph fusions are adapted to accommodate the extra complexity. For example, instead of
			manually matching fusion patterns in the graph, ONNX Runtime now supports automated pattern
			matching. Rather than detect large subgraphs by hand and match the many paths they form,
			fusion opportunities can instead be identified by exporting a large module as a function and
			then pattern matching against a function's spec.
		</p>
        <figure class="px-10 pt-4">
			<img src={figure6} alt="Example of Rotary Embedding Function" />
			<figcaption class="mt-2 mb-4 text-center">
				Figure 6: Example of Rotary Embedding Function
			</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p class="mb-4">
			As a concrete example, Figure 6 is an example of the nodes that comprise rotary embedding
			computations. Pattern matching against this subgraph is cumbersome because of the number of
			paths to verify. By exporting this as a function, the parent view of the graph will only show
			the inputs and outputs and represent all these nodes as a single operator.
		</p>

        <figure class="px-10 pt-4">
			<img src={figure7} alt="Example of Rotary Embedding Function in Parent Graph" />
			<figcaption class="mt-2 mb-4 text-center">
				Figure 7: Example of Rotary Embedding Function in Parent Graph
			</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p class="mb-4">
			This approach makes it easier to maintain and support future versions of the rotary embeddings
			computations because the pattern matching is only dependent on the operator's inputs and
			outputs instead of its internal semantic representation. It also allows other existing
			implementations of rotary embeddings in similar models such as GPT-NeoX, Falcon, Mistral,
			Zephyr, etc. to be pattern matched and fused with minimal or no changes.
		</p>

		<p class="mb-4">
			ONNX Runtime also adds support for GroupQueryAttention (GQA) operator, which leverages the new
			Flash Attention V2 algorithm and its optimized kernels to efficiently compute attention. The
			GQA operator supports past-present buffer sharing between the past key/value cache (past KV
			cache) and the present key/value cache (present KV cache). By binding the present KV caches to
			the past KV caches, there is no need to allocate separate on-device memory for both caches.
			Instead, the past KV caches can be pre-allocated with enough on-device memory so that no new
			on-device memory needs to be requested during inference. This reduces memory usage when the KV
			caches become large during compute-intensive workloads and lowers latency by eliminating
			on-device memory allocation requests. The past-present buffer sharing can be enabled or
			disabled without needing to change the ONNX model, allowing greater flexibility for end users
			to decide which approach is best for them.
		</p>

		<p class="mb-4">
			The optimizations work for the Hugging Face versions (models ending with -hf). You can
			download the optimized HF versions from Microsoft's LLaMA-2 ONNX repository. Stay tuned for
			newer Microsoft versions coming soon!

		<h2 class="text-blue-500 text-3xl mb-4">Optimize your own model using Olive</h2>

		<p class="mb-4">
			Olive is a hardware-aware model optimization tool that incorporates advanced techniques such
			as model compression, optimization, and compilation. We have made ONNX Runtime optimizations
			available through Olive so you can streamline the entire optimization process for a given
			hardware with simple experience.
		</p>

		<p class="mb-4">
			Here is the example of Llama2 optimization with Olive, which harnesses ONNX Runtime
			optimizations highlighted in this blog. Distinct optimization flows cater to various
			requirements. For instance, you have the flexibility to choose different data types for
			quantization in CPU and GPU inference, based on your accuracy tolerance. Additionally, you can
			fine-tune your own Llama2 model with Olive-QLoRa on client GPUs and perform inference with
			ONNX Runtime optimizations.

		<p class="mb-4">
			Here is a sample notebook that shows you an end-to-end example of how you can use the above
			ONNX Runtime Optimizations in your application.
		</p>

		<h2 class="text-blue-500 text-3xl mb-4">Conclusion</h2>

		<p class="mb-4">
			The advancements discussed in this blog provide faster Llama2 inferencing with ONNX Runtime,
			offering exciting possibilities for AI applications and research. With improved performance
			and efficiency, the horizon is wide open for innovation, and we eagerly await new applications
			built with Llama2 and ONNX Runtime by its vibrant community of developers. Stay tuned for more
